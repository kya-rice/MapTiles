# MapTiles

The four maps I created as shown below, I created using tilesets. All of these maps represent the Seattle, Washington area. I used a blue monochrome basemap for map 1 and map 3. For map 2 I used a streets layer to represent geospatial data of abandoned roads in washington. I later then used the data from map 2 and layered it onto the basemap I used for map 2. Finally for map 4 I used MapBox Cartogram feature to create this abadoned dirty theme to continue on with my abandoned roads theme. I also used a minimum zoom of 1 and maximum zoom of 10 for all of my tilesets.

# Map 1: Monochrome Basemap

This is a map of a tileset that is a blue monochrome basemap of the Seattle, Washington Area.

# Map 2: Abandoned Roads

This is a map I created from a tileset using a streets basemap layer. I used abandoned roads data for Washington State that I found on the Washington State Department of Natural Resource GIS Open Data website, and I layered it onto the streets basemap layer.

# Map 3: Abandoned Roads and Basemap

This is a tileset that was created using the monochrome basemap (map 1) and layering the data from the abandoned roads map (map 2) on top of the basemap.


# Map 4: Abandoned Roads Theme

For this map I created it using a tileset that I created using MapbBox Cartogram feature in order to maintain the abondoned road theme. Here I uplaoded an image of an abandoned road which produced this "muddy" looking basemap map. I then added the abdoned roads data as a layer onto this map.
